<p class="aboutmetext"> I am Paulina Gonzalez-Heres, a full-time student enrolled at University of Pennsylvania LPS Coding Boot Camp studying Full Stack Development. The passion for technology and computer programming began as a child. My mind as a youngster always wondered how machines and computers worked. With the help and influence of my father, a former computer and electrical engineer at IBM, he encouraged me to pursue a career and admiration for the field. As I entered my secondary school, I decided to go to iD Tech Camp at Villanova University for three summers back to back. I began to gain knowledge and experience coding in Java, C++ and Xcode. Those formative years at camp made a huge impact on my love and ambition to become a programmer. As I continued into high school I propelled into classes like Introduction to Video Game Programming I&II, Introduction to Computer Programming, Computer Graphics I&II , Photoshop, and Java. With the love and support of my teachers at high school I decided to enroll at Full Sail University. The months I had been a student at Full Sail University, studying Mobile Development made me realize that programming is my passion and is what makes me who I am.  I decided to pause my education at university, for personal reasons which lead me to join University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s boot camp to immerse myself in a new field of coding.  </p>
